# Traveler’s Tavern: Python Text-Based Mock Kiosk

A Python-based text UI prototype for a self-ordering restaurant kiosk. Simulates the ordering process at Traveler’s Tavern, an international-themed eatery. This project showcases a user-friendly menu system, order customization, and receipt generation—all within a command-line interface. Designed to demonstrate efficiency, user control, and innovation in food service technology.

This was made in partial fulfillment of the requirements for my Computer Fundamental Programming 1 Final Project on my 1st year in Civil Engineering.
